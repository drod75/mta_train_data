### **Welcome to the MTA Ridership Analysis App!**

This app is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of MTA ridership data!
It includes features for visualizing ridership trends, identifying key stations and lines, and making data-driven recommendations for improving the MTA system!

Along with this the pages we have here are:
- **MTA Log**
- **MTA Ridership**
- **MTA Line Suggestion**
- **MT-AI**

In the **MTA Log** page you can view the latest MTA News!

In the **MTA Ridership** page you can view a map of the subway stations and their ridership, an overview of the ridership, and an analysis of the ridership!

In the **Line Suggestion** page you can view the most popular routes and see what theoretical line could be built to connect them!

In the **MT-AI** page you can input a prompt and the app will generate a response using a LLM!

We hope you find this app helpful!
